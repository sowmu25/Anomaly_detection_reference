Time Series Anomaly detection

Tasks:
	creating Workflow of Anomaly Detection on Time series data 
		- (D:\Files\Metrics\Documents\Doc1.docx)
	Working on different forecasting algorithms - validate to find the best model 
		- holtwinters, Nbeatsmodel (D:\Files\Metrics\Documents\Exponential smoothening Model.docx)
	working on different anomaly detecting algorithms - validate to find the best model 
		- isolation forest, one class svm (D:\Files\Metrics\Documents\Anomaly_Detection_Documentation.docx)
	Darts - python library for timeseries forecasting and anomaly detection
		-  (https://unit8co.github.io/darts/README.html)

To dos:
	pattern identification which leads to anomaly
	predictive maintenence 
	Integrate the entire process 
	

challenges faced:
	Installing darts library
		- dependencies package installation issues
			- trying to resolve by creating virtual environment to run darts library 
		  	  which is a combination of ML and DL models (C:\Users\sowmiya.sivakumar\Darts_ts\Readme)
